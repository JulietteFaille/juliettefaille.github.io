## About Me

I am a third-year PhD student in Computer Science at [CNRS/LORIA](https://www.loria.fr/fr/). I am part of the [Synalp research team](https://synalp.gitlabpages.inria.fr/synalp-website/), and  my PhD advisors are Claire Gardent and Albert Gatt. I am also an Early Stage Researcher in the [NL4XAI Marie Curie Project](https://nl4xai.eu/) .

Before starting my PhD, I graduated with an MSc in Electrical Engineering and Information Technology from ETH Zurich and an Electrical Engineering Degree from CentraleSup√©lec.
My Master thesis was on Approximation Theorectic Properties of Deep Neural Networks.


## Research Interests
My research is on the evaluation and explainability of Natural Language Generation (NLG) Models.

My research interests are in Text Generation, NLG Evaluation, XAI (in particular applied to NLP/NLG models), Graph-to-Text, and Omissions and Hallucinations of NLG models. 
I'm also interested in NLP ethics-related questions.
